# UCLA CS275 Course Project: Unofficial Implementation of [Wei Shao and Demetri Terzopoulos. 2005] Autonomous Pedestrians.

The Autonomous Pedestrian Model achieves unprecedented reality and complexity for fully autonomous multi-human simulation in both individual and crowd scales. Its efficiency and scalability are well-suited for crowd simulations in large urban environments. In this course project, we fully reimplemented this model from scratch, using Python and the modern game engine Unreal Engine 5. Our implementation includes a 2D prototype for navigation and reactive behaviors algorithm validation and a 3D game engine integration. We leverage Unreal's animation blueprint and scene management systems to achieve natural character animation modeling and realistic crowds in the train station scenes.
